# ResearchGPT
This is an app that will demonstrate bindings. This is modified from the original flask app (here)[https://github.com/mukulpatnaik/researchgpt]

The app will then extract the text from the pdf, 
create embeddings from the text and use them with the openai api 
to generate a response to a question you ask. 
The app will also return a source for the part of the text it used to generate the response and the page number.
